AROMA COFFEE SHOP SALES DASHBOARD
Project Overview:
This project involves creating an interactive sales analytics dashboard for Aroma Coffee Shop to monitor weekly sales performance across multiple locations in Indonesia (Jakarta, Malang, Bandung, and Jepara). The goal is to provide real time insights into key business metrics that enable data-driven decision-making for operational efficiency, inventory management, and revenue optimization.
The dashboard focuses on several critical areas, including sales trends, product performance, inventory status, location-based revenue distribution, and order tracking. By visualizing these metrics through an interactive Tableau dashboard, the project aims to help coffee shop managers identify top-selling products, optimize stock levels, understand geographic sales patterns, and improve overall business performance.
Problem Statement:
Aroma Coffee Shop faces challenges in tracking real time sales performance, managing inventory efficiently across multiple locations, and identifying which products drive the most revenue. Additionally, understanding location-based sales patterns and peak shopping times is crucial for optimizing staffing and inventory distribution.
To address these challenges, this project aims to answer the following questions:
•	Which products generate the most revenue and should be prioritized for inventory?
•	How do sales vary across different locations (Jakarta, Malang, Bandung, Jepara)?
•	What are the weekly sales trends and how do they compare to previous periods?
•	Which products require restocking and when?
•	What are the peak shopping days and times for better resource allocation?
•	How many orders are processed weekly and what is the average order value?
By analyzing this data, the dashboard provides actionable insights to improve inventory management, optimize product mix, enhance customer service, and increase profitability.
